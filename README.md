# API-example
This is an example of an ETL process by using the TMDb and OMDb databases which uses a NoSQL format
In particular, we can find that the main format is a JSON which in this particular project, is transformed to a normalized data by using pandas 
At the end, we use the download method in order to download a csv file which allow us to understand better the output data rather than the JSON format
